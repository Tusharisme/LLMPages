# LLMPages

**LLMPages** is a static website designed to showcase a diverse collection of digital assets and generated content. Created as part of a specific technical task, it serves as a central hub for various "pages" ranging from short stories and ethical dilemmas to visual graphics and data predictions. The entire application runs fully client-side, making it highly portable and easily deployable.

## Overview

This repository hosts a simple, client-side web application. Its primary purpose is to present a curated set of files—including text documents, JSON data, Markdown descriptions, and SVG images—through a single, easy-to-navigate homepage. Each piece of content addresses a unique prompt or provides specific information, demonstrating a breadth of content generation and assembly capabilities.

## How It Works

The core of LLMPages is the `index.html` file, which acts as the main entry point and navigation dashboard. Upon opening `index.html` in a web browser, users are presented with a series of links. Each link points directly to a corresponding content file located within the repository.

The application leverages standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide a seamless client-side experience. Content files are served directly as static assets, meaning no server-side processing is required. Users can simply click on a link to view the raw content of a `.txt`, `.json`, `.md`, or `.svg` file directly in their browser or as a downloaded asset, depending on browser configuration.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate the application's entry point from its content files:

-   **`index.html`**: The main homepage, providing links and brief descriptions for all available content files.
-   **`LICENSE`**: The MIT License file, detailing the terms under which this project is distributed.
-   **`uid.txt`**: A unique identifier file as provided during the task.
-   **`/input/`**: This directory contains all the distinct content files accessible from the homepage:
    -   `ashravan.txt`: A fictional short story written in the style of Brandon Sanderson.
    -   `dilemma.json`: A JSON file outlining an ethical dilemma for an autonomous vehicle.
    -   `about.md`: A Markdown file containing a brief self-description.
    -   `pelican.svg`: An SVG graphic depicting a pelican riding a bicycle.
    -   `restaurant.json`: A JSON file recommending a restaurant in Mumbai.
    -   `prediction.json`: A JSON file containing a prediction for the Fed Funds rate.

## How to Use / Run

Alternatively, you can visit the live deployment of this site if it's hosted on GitHub Pages or a similar static site hosting service.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages and content.
-   **CSS3**: (Implicitly) For basic styling and layout of the `index.html` page.
-   **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality within `index.html` (if any, typically for minor UI enhancements or dynamic content display).

## Deployment Notes

LLMPages is perfectly suited for static site hosting platforms like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To deploy:

1.  Ensure your `main` branch (or configured publishing branch) contains the `index.html` and `/input/` directory at its root.
2.  Configure your GitHub repository settings to publish from the `main` branch.
3.  The site will be accessible at `https://your-username.github.io/LLMPages/`.
